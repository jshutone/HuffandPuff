# A Huffman Algorithm-Based Data Compression Project

Greetings! We present to you HuffandPuff, a project born out of our file structures class, where we delved into the intricacies of implementing the Huffman algorithm for efficient data compression. Our objective was not only to compress data but to go a step further by developing a robust program for decompression, ensuring the seamless restoration of data into a readable format.
